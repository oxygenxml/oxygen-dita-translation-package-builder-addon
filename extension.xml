					<p>This add-on contributes contextual menu actions that help you
						build a translation package for DITA files that can be sent to
						translators. You can also extract the changed files back into your
						project once you receive the package back from the translators.
					</p>
					<p>
						It contributes a sub-menu
						named "Translation Package Builder" in the
						<b>DITA Maps Manager</b>
						's contextual menu. The
						actions present in this group are:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Generate Milestone</b>
							- this action is the first one to use. It will generate an unique
							hash
							for each documentation resource. This information will be used by
							the second action to detect which files
							have been modified. A milestone file should be generated the first
							time you install this plugin and, afterwards,
							after each package sent to translators.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Create Modified Files Package</b>
							- this action detects which files have been
							changed since the last generated milestone. These files are packed
							insdie a ZIP
							file that can be send to translators. After doing this you can also
							generate a
							new milestone so that the next package will contain just the new
							changes.
							<p>
								This
								action also creates a report with the modified resources
								(
								<b>modified_resources_report.xhtml</b>
								). If your translation agency is
								DITA-aware you can opt to send him the entire DITA project together with
								this report.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Apply Package</b>
							- when the translated files arrive from the translator you should
							open the DITA map
							that corresponds to the received language (open
							dita-map-french.ditamap if the package contains the french
							translation).
							Invoking this action will extract the changed files inside map's
							directory.
						</li>
					</ol>
